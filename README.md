Proud to share the completion of Task-03 as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech 🚀

For this task, I built a Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on creating an interactive and user-friendly experience. The application efficiently handles user clicks, game state management, turn switching, and winning condition checks, making the gameplay smooth and engaging.

This project significantly improved my understanding of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, conditional statements, and event handling, while also reinforcing the importance of writing clean, structured code by separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

I’m grateful to Prodigy Infotech for providing hands-on learning opportunities that help bridge the gap between theory and real-world development. Looking forward to taking on more challenging tasks and growing further as a frontend developer 🌱# PRODIGY_WD_03
